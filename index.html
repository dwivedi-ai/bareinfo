        <p>Hi there! I am a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>, and yeah, I know what you're thinking: "Where's all the flashy stuff?".</p>
        <p>Sure, I could have just plastered this page with just enough animations to trigger a seizure, but let's get real. I don't play dress up with my website. I like to keep it simple. This bad boy right here, loads faster than a speeding bullet, and is as light as a feather. This thing will load instantly on a 2G connection from the middle of the desert on a 10-year-old phone. So, while other websites are still loading their 50 shades of gradients, you're already here.</p>
        <p><strong>"Good design is as little design as possible." - Dieter Rams</strong></p>
        <p>Here is something about myself... I am 4th year engineering student in Computer Science at KIIT University, India. I have been coding for quite sometime. When I was a kid, I was fascinated (still fascinated) by Iron Man, Space, Robots and all the other sci-fi stuff. So, that inspired me to start coding. Some things are a little complicated for me to explain, like- I was highly interested in Physics yet I'm studying CSE right now, I was highly interesting in film making and yet again I am studying CSE right now. But its not like that I don't like coding, I love it! <strong>I am highly interested in low-level systems development.</strong> I was also the head boy of my school (2021-22) and I have won a national coding competition- Code2Win (2021) by Eupheus Learning, with guess what rank? 1!</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
                I tinker with a few things when I'm bored. The serious documentation is on GitHub, where it belongs.
            </p>
            <h3>Core Projects</h3>
            <p>Well, I am quite unsure if I should add them or not as most of them are current <strong>not-live</strong> due to different issues like exhausted free-tier credits, etc.</p>
            
            <h3>Avg Projects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Srimad Bhagavatam RAG Chatbot:</strong> A total vibe-coded project. I wanted to see if an AI could learn reverence, so I built this RAG chatbot that answers questions strictly from the holy scriptures.

                    <a href="https://github.com/dwivedi-ai/srimadbhagvat_rag" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>ACS Language Compiler:</strong> Wrote a custom language (ACS) and its compiler. Instead of building a whole backend from scratch, it cleverly transpiles the ACS code to C++ and lets the perfected g++ compiler do the heavy lifting. Work smart, not hard.
                    <a href="https://github.com/dwivedi-ai/acs" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enigma Post Systems:</strong> One of my first full-stack projects, a MERN social media app built in 5 days when I was just starting out. The code is a mess and it can't scale, but hey, it worked. A true rite of passage.
                    <a href="https://github.com/dwivedi-ai/enigmapost" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Joke Projects (PS: DON'T TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY)</h3>
            <p>And here are some things for you to tinker around, mostly for a quick laugh.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe:</strong> An AI player using Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning. Go ahead, try to win. It's a great way to waste your time and question your intelligence.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fake Hacking Simulator:</strong> Looks like a suspicious hacking tool from a 90s movie. Click at your own risk (don't worry, it's safe... probably).
                    <a href="https://github.com/dwivedi-ai/FakeHack" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Background Colour Changer:</strong> A website that changes its background color when you tap it. That's it. That's the whole project.
