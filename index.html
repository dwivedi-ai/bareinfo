        Hi there! I am a <b>Software Engineer</b>, and yeah, I know what you're thinking: "Where's all the flashy stuff?".
        <br>
        <br>
        Sure, I could have just plastered this page with just enough animations to trigger a seizure, but let's get real.
        I don't play dress up with my website. I like to keep it simple.
        This bad boy right here, loads faster than a speeding bullet, and is as light as a feather.
        So, while other websites are still loading their 50 shades of gradients, you're already here.
        <br>

        <br>
        Here is something about myself... I am 4th year engineering student in Computer Science at KIIT University, India. I have been coding for quite sometime. When I was a kid, I was fascinated (still fascinated) by Iron Man, Space, Robots and all the other sci-fi stuff. So, that inspired me to start coding. Some things are a little complicated for me to explain, like- I was highly interested in Physics yet I'm studying CSE right now, I was highly interesting in film making and yet again I am studying CSE right now. But its not like that I don't like coding, I love it! <b>I am highly interested in low-level systems development.</b> I was also the head boy of my school (2021-22) and I have won a national coding competition- Code2Win (2021) by Eupheus Learning, with guess what rank? 1!
