    <h2>A near-death experience</h2>

    <p>It is a gift that I'm able to read and write this. It is a gift that my physical, verbal, and logical abilities are still intact after the head injury I had gone through a week ago. I lost consciousness back then, and thanks to my friends who took me to the hospital in time. I had lost a lot of blood and what they did was nothing short of life-saving, if not entirely so, and I'll be forever grateful to them.</p>

    <p>From 2:30 AM to 7:00 AM, I was unconscious, and when I woke up, it felt very embarrassing first of all. I didn't want to be such a bother, but I thought that maybe because I was on medication. But when I came back to my room and processed all the information... I just looked at my hands and I closed it and opened it again, and after a brief moment of realisation I thanked god, I thanked the energy that's running this universe, grateful that even after such an incident, my brain was still able to perform all the functions normally.</p>

    <p>I was aware of the fragility of life and I always tried to imagine and visualise the quote said by Steve Jobs "if this were the last day of my life, would I do what I am about to do?", but that day I truly understood the quote. I really felt the fear of dying before making a dent in the universe.</p>

    <p>And maybe it'll sound funny to you all, but ever since I was a kid, I have always been fascinated by human endeavours and I always believed that one day, I will also be able to make something that'll change and push the world in a better way forward. But 1 week ago was when I realised how quantised my time is and how limited I am by my mortality.</p>

    <p>I want to understand this world, I want to understand how the universe works, and I want to build things that will improve people's lives. I want the future generations to remember me for being a person who contributed to the advancement of all humankind. And since the last one week, I have been constantly thinking about this - not what I have already done and wasted my time, etc., but what I have to do now.</p>

    <p>When I look out from my balcony, I see a world that is learning and growing, which fascinates me with the spirit of humankind. Our determination to not just reach our limits, but to expand them. This made me so proud to be a human being, and again, I'm thankful to my genes, that are an expert at making and controlling the processes of a human body like mine.</p>
